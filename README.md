# Options

* `data-article-selector` (required): the selector that contains the article with headings in it.
* `data-linkify` (type: `"true" | "false"`) (default: `true`): if true, the web component will create `id` for each heading lacks one, making the minimap "ticks" clickable.
* `data-vibrate` (type: `"true" | "false"`) (default: `true`): if true, uses the [Vibration API](https://www.w3.org/TR/vibration/) to "click" the device when a header is scrolled past. The idea was to recreate the iPod click wheel.
* `data-active-state` (type: `string`) (default: `"●"`): which character (or characters) will represent the "active" heading.
* `data-inactive-state` (type: `string`) (default: `"○"`): which character (or characters) will represent "inactive" headings.
